# CS527
The repository contains the implemented projects of CS 527 at WSU Vancouver. These projects are implemented by Python language.
- Project 1: a program for the block-encryption algorithm is called WSU-CRYPT (based on Twofish by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall and SKIPJACK by the NSA combined). WSU-CRYPT is described below. Implement WSU-CRYPT using a 64 bit block size and a 80 bit key. 
- Project 2: a program for the public-key cryptosystem. The program encrypt/decrypt a file of any length. Since this cipher is based on modulo exponentiations all input and output files can contain integers. In this case, treat text
as ASCII.
